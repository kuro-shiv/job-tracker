# 📌 About the Job Tracker Project

The Job Tracker is a web-based application designed to help users efficiently manage and track their job applications in one place. Instead of manually remembering application statuses, follow-ups, or company details, this project provides a structured and user-friendly solution to organize the entire job search process.

This project focuses on improving productivity for job seekers by allowing them to add, update, and monitor job applications with ease. It is especially useful for students, freshers, and professionals applying to multiple companies simultaneously.

# 🎯 Purpose of the Project

The main goal of this project is to:

Simplify job application tracking

Reduce confusion around application status and follow-ups

Provide a centralized dashboard for job search progress

This project also serves as a hands-on learning experience to strengthen frontend development skills and understand real-world application workflows.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is currently not compatible with SWC. See [this issue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/issues/428) for tracking the progress.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
